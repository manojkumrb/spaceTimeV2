Details of data files on pc for space time kalman filter all data files in megara

allDataInner_eig2.mat 					: prediction with krigging to test the effect of number of basis vectors

allDataInner_eigBatch1NumBasis30WoKrig 	: Prediction withput krigging with 30 basis vectors for testing effect of number of batches used for learning
										  Batch1 means fourth batch used to test prediction, eigen basis created successively with 1,2,3, batches

allDataInner_eigWOk2.mat				: prediction without krigging to test the effect of number of basis vectors										

doorInnerSelNodes 						: coordinates of key points, ie points used in kalman filter (has 559 points)

interEigVecs25_90_directionChange 		: interpolated eigen vectors first obtained after nodifying the claculation of barycentric coordinates

optimisedHypParmHinge					: gpr optimsed hyper parameters obtained after averaging optimisations of many batches

predEigBatch3NumBasis30WoKrigBatchCombined     : Prediction without krigging with 30 basis vectors for testing effect of number of batches used for learning
										  Batch3 means 6th batch used to test prediction with basis formed from three batches, ie eigen basis created joining data from 1,2,3 batches
										  
simAutoCorDevInnerBatchesCombined 		: Deviation patterns obtained from simulation, containes 10 batches of simulated data with 50 instances each 
										  also contains deviatons of NC block and clamps
											
innerSelNodes - Copy.inp 				: mesh file of the coarse mesh obtained from cgal by advancing front construction		
deterministicPredHinge.mat				: prediction for hinge with all possible combinations of measurement sequence (1-5 regions) 25 eigen basis
gprPredSourceBatch6Inner 				: for comparision between space and space time ..has gpr predicitons for all 40 patterns of batch 6 of inner through gpr with optimised hyp from save file.
